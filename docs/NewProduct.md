# How to use Plaster to generate your project stub

## Install Plaster
Plaster is completely open source and hosted on the PowerShell Teamï¿½s [Github](https://github.com/PowerShell/Plaster). We can grab the most
recent version from the PowerShell gallery using the below command.

```
Install-Package -Name Plaster -Source PSGallery -Verbose -Force -ForceBootstrap
````

In our source tree, you will see a **plastertemplates/product** folder

<img src="./media/PlasterTemplates-ProjectFolders.png" alt="Plaster project template folder hiearchy" />

This folder contains the templates for all of the required files and folders that will need to be created
for you new product.

## Creating your project stub
If you are adding a new product to the OnPrem Diagnostic suite, you can use plaster to *jump-start* your coding.

To create a project stub using Plaster, execute the following:

```
Invoke-Plaster
           -TemplatePath <path to plastertemplates folder>\product
           -Destination <path to destination folder>
           -Name <Product Name Goes Here>
           -Description "Product Description Goes Here"
```

This will generate stub folder hierarchy for your new product

````
PS> Invoke-plaster -TemplatePath .\plastertemplates\product\ -DestinationPath c:\temp\ -Name MyNewProduct -Description "Product description"

You have just generated the minimal folder structure for your product. You will notice that during the creation
process, that you were asked if you wanted to *Include Pester Tests?* in your output. If you selected *[Y] Yes*
(the default), sample test files were generated in the *Tests* folder under your project.

Here is what the folder hierarchy looks like after generation

<img src="./media/ProjectStub.png" alt="Newly created project stub" />

Let's take a closer look at the generated files and the actions required.

### config.json
<img src="./media/ProjStub-config.json.png" alt="Newly created project stub" />

The *config.json* file is used to enumerate the different areas in your product that you want to
group scenarios in. For example, if you want to group scenarios in Area1, Area2, etc., you would have
something similar to the following:

````json
{
  "areas": [
    {
      "area": "area1"
    },
    {
      "area":  "area2"
    }
  ]
}
````

### Common files

<img src="./media/ProjStub-commonfiles.png" alt="Product common files" />

There are two (2) files that will should be included with each project. They are *Globals.ps1* and *[ProductName].ps1*.

#### Globals.ps1
This file will contain any Product specific global values. This can include things such as global variables,
enumerations, etc.

### Locale specific files

<img src='./media/ProjStub-localefiles.png' alt='Locale specific files' />

Plaster will generate the following [required] resx files for you to modify. By default,
English is the only language that is stubbed. If additional languages are required, simply
follow the same naming convention. For example, if you wanted to add French resource files,
they would be named [FileName].fr-FR.resx

| Filename | Description |
|----------|-------------|
|AnalyzerDescriptions| The description used by the analyzer |
|AreaDescriptions| The description used by the areas|
|AreaTitles|Area titles used to group scenarios|
|InsightActions|The action that is required to mitigate the failure|
|InsightDescription|The description of what was found|
|RuleDescription|The description of what the rule will look for|
|ScenarioDescription|The description of what the scenario is looking for|

### Test file stubs

<img src="./media/ProjStub-testfiles.png" alt="Test file stubs" />

Plaster will generate sample test scripts for analyzers, insights, rules, and scenarios. Each of these
stub files will validate that the required entries are in the appropriate resource files. You can use these
as a starting point to develop more specific test cases for you code.

All of the stub files are similar in structure/content and vary by the type of files it is looking at. Also,
the variables defined at the top of the Pester script can be modified to suit your needs. By default, they are
geared towards insertion into the existing development/testing framework.
